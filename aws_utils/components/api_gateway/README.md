# API Gateway
	API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to publish, maintain, monitor and secure APIs at any scale.

	Expose HTTPS endpoints to define a RESTful API
	Serverless-ly connect to services like Lambda & DynamoDB
	Send each API endpoint to a different target
	Run efficiently with low cost
	Scale effortlessly: scale automatically along with your traffic
	Track and control usage by API key
	Throttle requests to prevent attacks
	Connect to CloudWatch to log all requests for monitoring
	Maintain multiple versions of your API
    We can enable API caching to cache your endpointâ€™s response. With caching, we can reduce the number of calls made to your endpoint and also improve the latency of the requests to your API. When you enable caching for a stage, API Gateway caches from your endpoint for a specified time-to-live (TTL) period, in seconds. API Gateway then responds to the request by looking up the endpoint response from the cache instead of making a request to your endpoint.
